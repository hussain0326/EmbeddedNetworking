# Embedded Networking Project – Weather Clock

## Project Description

This project is a Weather Clock with multiple features. It displays time, date, and weather information in a flexible and user-friendly way. Users can adjust the clock settings and view weather characteristics.

A key feature is energy saving: the clock uses a motion sensor to control the display, reducing power consumption when no one is nearby. The project combines practical IoT/embedded networking concepts with real-world usability.
